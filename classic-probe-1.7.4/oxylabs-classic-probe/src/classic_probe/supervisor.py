"""The outer bound of a whole session (1.7.0, finding C2; corrected in 1.7.1 and 1.7.2).

A request's worker is killed and reaped at the request's own deadline (transport.py). This module bounds the
rest: a campaign session runs in its own process, and the supervisor kills it, with every process it started,
reaps it, and then recovers in its own process. Rows the session left reserved or sent are kept as unknown
(``Ledger.recover``: their reservations stay held), capture files are indexed or removed
(``CaptureStore.recover``), and an evidence manifest marked incomplete is written from the durable index.

1.7.1 (the client's review of 1.7.0, finding C2): in 1.7.0 the recovery ran after the session's end with no
bound of its own: a ledger lock held elsewhere kept it waiting 30 s and then raised, and a killed session that
could not be reaped raised out of the supervisor with nothing recovered. Now the supervisor's whole run ends
by the session's hard end:

- the session's command runs until the hard end less a reserve kept for the recovery
  (:func:`classic_probe.deadline.recovery_reserve`: a third of a short session, 30 s at most);
- its kill and its reap are each bounded by the time left. A process that has not gone when its reap's time
  runs out is recorded (``reaped``: False), and the recovery still runs;
- the recovery runs in its own process, which the supervisor kills if it is still running at the hard end.
  Inside it, every wait for the ledger's lock is bounded by the same end (``Ledger.bind_time_left``), so a
  lock held elsewhere ends the recovery's ledger writes, not the recovery: it writes the manifest of what it
  found and says what it could not do (``completed``: False, and why). A row it could not mark stays as the
  session left it, its money held, for the next recovery to mark. Nothing is assumed.

1.7.2 (the client's review of 1.7.1, finding C2). On Linux the 1.7.1 supervisor waited 1.10 s for a FIFO put
at the evidence path, despite a hard end of 0.30 s: it opened the path as a file, and opening a FIFO waits for
a writer. It accepted the complete evidence manifest a previous run had left in the same folder when a new
command exited 0 without writing any (its only test was the file's age). A process the session left behind
kept running after a session that exited by itself, and the recovery's bound was passed on the wall clock.
Now:

- one monotonic deadline bounds everything the supervisor does: the command, the end of its process tree,
  the reading of its evidence and the recovery, which is given the same monotonic end (``--until-monotonic``;
  Python's monotonic clock is system-wide). :func:`run_session` returns within the hard end plus
  :data:`TOLERANCE_S`, whatever the session did;
- the session's process tree is ended whenever the session ends, by itself or by its kill (proctree.py: a
  process group on Linux and macOS, a job object on Windows), so no process it started can send anything
  once the supervisor has returned; the session's output goes to a temporary file, not a pipe that a
  left-behind process could hold open;
- the session's evidence is read only if it is a regular file (never a FIFO, a device, a directory or a
  link), no larger than :data:`MAX_EVIDENCE_BYTES`, opened without blocking and read within the time left;
  and it is accepted only if it names this campaign, this ledger and this execution: each run gets a new
  ``execution_id`` in the session's environment (:data:`classic_probe.campaign.EXECUTION_ENV`), which the
  campaign writes into its evidence. An earlier run's manifest, however recent, is not this run's: the run
  is recovered, and the earlier file is left as it was.

1.7.4 (the client's review of probe 1.7.2 on Windows). A session whose process could not be held by a job
object still ran in 1.7.2 (the tree fell back to ``taskkill /T``), and a cleanup whose result could not be
told was reported with nothing left running and no problem. Now (proctree.py):

- a session runs only once its process tree is held: on Windows its process stays suspended until a job object
  is shown to hold it. When that fails, :func:`run_session` returns an explicit refusal (``refused``: True,
  ``status``: ``refused``), after the suspended process was ended and reaped; the command ran nothing, started
  nothing and sent nothing, and nothing is recovered, because nothing was done;
- the session's tree is taken as gone only when its own account says so (``cleanup``: ``verified``). A cleanup
  that ``failed`` or is ``unknown`` is kept as such in the result (``status``: ``cleanup-failed`` or
  ``cleanup-unknown``, ``left_running`` and ``gone`` None when unknown, a problem that says it) and in the
  evidence: the session's own evidence is not taken, a recovery runs, and its manifest names the cleanup
  (``session_tree_cleanup``). ``status`` is ``ok`` only for a session that ended by itself with exit code 0
  and its own complete evidence, and whose tree was verified gone.

The supervisor is the bound for a future approved live session. This build's live mode stays disabled: the
tests run it against a stub on 127.0.0.1 only.
