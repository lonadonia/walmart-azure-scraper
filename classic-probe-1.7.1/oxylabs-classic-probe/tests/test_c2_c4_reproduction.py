"""Reproductions of the two findings the client's review left open after 1.7.0 (C2 and C4), kept as tests.

Each test here was written against release 1.7.0 first and failed there (the log of that run is delivered with
1.7.1); release 1.7.1 makes it pass.

- C2: the one session deadline must also bound what happens after the requests: the ledger writes that record
  an answer or a stop, the evidence export, and the recovery a supervisor runs after it kills a session. In
  1.7.0 the recovery ran after the session's end with no bound of its own (a held ledger lock kept it waiting
  30 s, then it raised), the writes after an answer waited 30 s for the lock whatever time was left, and a
  process that could not be reaped after its kill raised out of the supervisor with nothing recovered.
- C4: an answer that reached the disk must survive a crash. In 1.7.0 the request worker's file, written and
  synced, was deleted by the transport before the kept copy was written, so a crash between the two lost a
  paid answer; the evidence files were renamed into place without being synced; and a body cut at its deadline
  left no record of what had arrived.

OFFLINE: every connection is a request worker's (a child process) to a stub on 127.0.0.1.
