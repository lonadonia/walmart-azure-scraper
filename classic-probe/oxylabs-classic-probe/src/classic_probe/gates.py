"""What must be true before a future Classic request, all of it checked before anything is reserved or sent.

Live mode is disabled in this build (:data:`LIVE_ENABLED`): turning it on takes a code change, a new version
and the owner's approval. :func:`evaluate` states every missing condition, so an owner can see what is
outstanding without any request: an explicit approval naming this campaign and this ledger, the account's
target entitlement verified by its owner, the account's maximum rates confirmed, and credentials present.

Credentials are read only by :func:`load_credentials`, and it is called only on the live path after every
other gate has passed. No offline mode reaches it.
