"""Task runner (brief §11): lease → handle → checkpoint → succeed / retry / block.

Handlers are async and receive a :class:`TaskContext`. They call ``ctx.checkpoint(cursor)`` before
every next navigation, so a crash resumes from the last durable cursor. Writes must be idempotent
(observations and memberships use unique keys), so re-processing a page after a crash cannot double
counts. Cancellation is cooperative: handlers check ``ctx.cancelled()`` between navigations.

Parallel workers of one execution form a :class:`WorkerGroup`: each leases its own tasks; a worker without
a leasable task waits while another worker of the group holds one (finishing it may unblock the next
stage); a stop one worker meets is seen by the others at their next check; the run's pause or cancellation
is applied once, by the group, after every worker has stopped.
