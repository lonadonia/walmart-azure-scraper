"""One active run per store (brief §11): a ``run_locks`` row plus a session-level advisory lock.

The advisory lock lives on a dedicated connection for the run's lifetime and disappears with the
process, so two live workers can never both hold it. The row makes the lock visible and records
heartbeats. A row left behind by a crashed worker is taken over by its own run at once (resume), by
another run once the old run is no longer active (stopped/finished), and otherwise only after
``expires_at`` passes with no heartbeat. Cron flags alone are never relied on.
